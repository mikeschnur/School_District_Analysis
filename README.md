# School_District_Analysis

## Purpose of Analysis
There had been data collected that compared several performance metrics between different high schools. After the School Board of Thomas High School reviewed their students' performance in math and reading, they found abnormalities in the scores of their 9th Grade class. The Board suspected the class had cheated. Thus, the School Soard had asked for an analysis to be done that would be unaffected by the tainted grades. 
## What was the effect on the data?
After removing the test scores of the 9th grade class the Average reading and math scores were calculated as well as the percentage fo students that passed math and reading as well as the overall percentage of students who passed.
The new data is reflected below
